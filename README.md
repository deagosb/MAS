This project attempts to demonstrate the use of some SOLID principles and design based on best practices.
Also, the code was builded using some design patterns like Factory Method and Repository. 
The Unit Test was builded using [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) 


## Components 

This implementation includes an .NET Core Web API and a Angular App Client. 
The .NET Core Web API was builded on Visual Studio Community Edition 2017.
The Angular App Client was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.11.
## Running the .NET Core Web API
Open the solution `MAS.sln` and run over `IIS Express` the URL `http://localhost:65504/api/employee` will be displayed. (Please do not close while run the Client App) 
## Running the Angular Client App
Open a command line on the directory `AngularClient` and run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
